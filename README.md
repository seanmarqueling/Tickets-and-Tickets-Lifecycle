# Tickets-and-Tickets-Lifecycle
The lifecycle of a ticket and how to use the ticketing system

In this lab I will show how to create tickets in osTicket as an end user and then how to resolve them as a member of the Help Desk.

## Instructions - Create help tickets and resolve the tickets

The first thing we are going to do is open up the End User home page for ticketing. [End User Ticketing](https://localhost/osTIcket/)
- Click on Open a New Ticket

For our first ticket, our technical problem will be that our entire mobile/online banking system is down.
- Email Address: Select the user we created (in this instance it is Kathy999999999@gmail.com
- Full Name: Kathy Bates (this should fill in automatically when selecting the Email Address).
- Help Topic: Report a Problem
- Issue Summary: entire mobile/online banking system is down
- Summary: My employees are reporting that users are no longer able to access their online banking portal. The one who can occasionally access it, cannot log in.

Our support is now made.

Now we are going to login to the [Agent Portal](http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php)
- Login in as John
- Click on the ticket that was created as the End User

Looking at the ticket, there are parameters that we should always go over:
- Status: Is the ticket open, closed, or resolved
- Priority: Is the ticket low, medium, high, or emergency priority
- Department: Which department is the ticket assigned to
- Assigned to: Is the ticket assigned to a specific help desk technician
- SLA Plan: What is the severity of the ticket
We will now go over the ticket and make updates to the parameters based on the problem of the ticket.
